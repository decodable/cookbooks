# Quick start

Configuration file _Vagrantfile_
```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
end
```
Command to make virtual environment up
```bash
vagrant up
```

# Basic
## [init](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/init.html)
```
vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64
vagrant up
```

## [suspend](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/suspend.html) & [resume](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/resume.html)
```
vagrant suspend
vagrant resume
```

## [halt](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/halt.html) & [up](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/up.html)

After making any modifications to the Vagrantfile, a reload should be called.

```
# vagrant reload = vagrant halt + vagrant up.

vagrant halt   # shut down
vagrant up
vagrant reload
vagrant provision
```

## [destory](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/destroy.html)
```
vagrant destroy
```

# Basic++
Vagrant = Box + Virtual Machine + Provisioning

Having a virtual machine ready is easy but not easier than setting up a real computer.
You need to 
1. install operating system. linux, Mac Os or windows.
2. setup the virtual machine. networking, shared folder.
3. install all the software.
Of course, after all setup, we can save it as an image, and load it anytime you need it.
However, when you install or update software, you have to create a new image.

Vagrant can help to do all things above and more.

## [Box](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/boxes.html)
```
mkdir ubuntu16.04
cd ubuntu16.04
vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64
```
It creates a file Vagrantfile in the current directory.
The file Vagrantfile looks like this:
```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/xenial64"
end
```

Boxes have all the information required to install your system. e.g. the image for the virtual machine.
When you execute `vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64`, it will automatically download the box from online reporsitory to local disk, so that next time it will not download again when you create another virtual machine.
The corresponding box info is https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/xenial64.
We can also use command `vagrant box` to manage box.

```
$ vagrant box add ubuntu/xenial64
$ vagrant box list
```

## [Virtual Machine](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/)
Vagrant supports different kind of virtual machines and call it [providers](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/). By default, it assume VirtualBox.

## [Provisioning](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/)


The Vagrantfile is the recipe to describe all this.

# My Vagrantfile
## Install Plugin
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize
```

# How React Works
1. property: Parent component build properties of child components. Update child components only when properties change. Properties are immuatable, one component cannot change it's own propterty.
2. state: State is internal and changable. State change will also trigger render of component.
3. Model change trigger the change of properties of root component, which will further change properties of child components.
4. State is intialized when properties change when component was is created.
5. State update interactively on events.
6. Model also update on events.

We have very limitted number of registers, which is also the difficulty when we program with assembly language. 

# Function
Function is a block of code, which also have address.

# Variable
In C++, we use variable to name an address.

# Local variable


# Global variable 
The address of global variable is known when the program was loaded.


# Pointer
Pointer is a variable, whose value is an address.

Reference 

We can only change the value of a variable, but not the address.

When we learn a script language, like Python, chances are we do not need to know the register or address of main memory.

In C/C++, we do not care about registers either.

However, regarding address, though we do not code with it directly, the concept is actually everywhere. 
It is more easy to understand language features together with address.


# Function
> name an address of code

Function is a block of code, which also have address.

# Variable
> name an address

In C++, we use variable to name an address.

We can only change the value of a variable, but not it's address.

# Local variable


# Global variable 
The address of global variable is known when the program was loaded.


# Pointer
> name an indirect address

Pointer is a variable, whose value is an address.

# Reference
> alias for a named address

Reference is an alias for a named address, direct or indirect.

# Rvalue reference. 
> new address for an object

Move an object - new address for an object, before it disappear.

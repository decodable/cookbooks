# RValue Reference
It is easy to understand yet may not very accurate.
> For an assignment, rvalue can **ONLY** appear on the right side, while lvalue can be on left or right side.

A variable reference to lvalue is called lvalue reference, we use *type &* to declare a lvalue reference.

A variable reference to rvalue is called rvalue reference, we use *type &&* to declare a rvalue reference.
